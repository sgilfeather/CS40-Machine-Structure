# CS40: Machine Structure and Programming

Assembly programming and low-level memory management in C, for the course CS40: Machine Structure and Programming. Included in this repo are projects completed for this course, including:
- `locality`: A PPM image rotator, which stores PPM pixels in cached blocks to optimize image transformations.
- `arith`: A lossy PPM image compressor, which converts full-color PPM images into compressed binary files.
- `cs40-um`: An interpreter that processes and executes bytecode for a unique, Turing-Complete assembly language, the `UM`.
- `c40-profiling`: A progressive optimization of the `UM`, eliminating wrapper modules and abstract data types, to run in **5.5%** of the original time.
- `cs40-asmcoding`: A RPN (Reverse-Polish Notation) calculator, implemented in a **macro language** for the `UM` assembly language.

For the sake of academic integrity, I unfortunately can't make my code for these projects public. However, I can share their specifications and design documents here. If you (a recruiter, a curious developer, etc.) would like to see the source code, please reach out. I'd be very happy to share my work with you!
